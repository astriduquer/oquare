## Welcome to OQuaRE Wiki

This Wiki is for discussing the characteristics and subcharacteristics of the ontology evaluation method called **OQuaRE** [1]. OQuaRE is a framework for evaluating ontology quality based on the standard **ISO/IEC 25000:2005** for Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) [2].  
Recent efforts have investigated how such software quality standards can be adapted to measure ontology quality, including approaches based on ISO 9126 [3].

## The Ontology Quality Evaluation Framework (OQuaRE)

SQuaRE covers two main processes:
1. Software quality requirements specifications.  
2. Software quality evaluation.

SQuaRE defines components like quality models, metrics, requirements, and evaluations. OQuaRE adapts this for ontologies by defining:
- **Evaluation support**  
- **Evaluation process**  
- **Metrics**  

The current version focuses on the **quality model** and **quality metrics** as essential elements for evaluating ontology quality.

---

## The OQuaRE Quality Model

The OQuaRE model adapts the following SQuaRE characteristics to ontologies:
- Functional adequacy  
- Reliability  
- Operability  
- Maintainability  
- Compatibility  
- Transferability  

Additionally, **structural features** are introduced to evaluate aspects not covered by SQuaRE, such as consistency, formalization, redundancy, or tangledness.
